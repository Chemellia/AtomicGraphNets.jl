# CrystalGraphConvNets.jl
Herein you can find the beginnings of a package to implement [Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10324) in Julia. It makes use of the [Flux](https://fluxml.ai) ecosystem for model building and the [JuliaGraphs](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs) ecosystem for graph representation and visualization, as well as adapting some features from [GeometricFlux](https://github.com/yuehhua/GeometricFlux.jl).


## Getting Started

1. Clone this package to wherever you want to play.

2. Go and try out the example in examples/example1/ – it has its own README file with detailed instructions.

## Future plans
* make tests, docs
* fix random weird stuff as noted in comments
* more options for features, layers, network architectures...

## Contact
Please feel free to fork and play, and reach out here on GitHub or to rkurchin [at] cmu [dot] edu with suggestions, etc.!
