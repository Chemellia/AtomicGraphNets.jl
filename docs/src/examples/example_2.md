# "Slab Graph" networks

This example demonstrates another model-builder convenience function, one to construct so-called "slab graph convolutional neural nets," as per [Kim et al.](dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b03686). The demonstration uses a small amount of data from the [Open Catalyst Project](https://opencatalystproject.org).

Because example 1 shows graph-building and featurization, here we provide prebuilt graphs to load in and use directly.
